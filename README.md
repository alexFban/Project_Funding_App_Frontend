# _Frontend Project Funder_
The frontend part of this project was made foar android devices using Android Studio Jellyfish in Kotlin.
The app constist of simple use cases such as: logging in, logging out, registration, visualising all available project, pledging for a particular project, creating a new project. I woul have liked to be able to implement more functionalites, but for the moment the app will stay like this.
The app is open to upgrades, as it can be evry easily modified, so adding the new features will be something easy and fast.
